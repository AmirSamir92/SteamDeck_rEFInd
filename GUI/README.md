# **GUI README**

More details will be coming soon. The basics are that the GUI installer will create all of the necessary files in the

`/home/deck/.SteamDeck_rEFInd/GUI/` folder. 

The Line edits are read-only and you must use the combo box file dialogs (browse buttons) to change background and icon PNG files (at least for now).

The background should be a 1,280x800 PNG file. Please use a program like GIMP to size appropriately and 'export as PNG file'. The icons should be 128x128 PNGs.

Feedback is welcome. I have tested this thoroughly enough to release it. Enjoy!
